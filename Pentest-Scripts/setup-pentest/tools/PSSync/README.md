PSSync is a python script to synchronize PacketStorm News/ Files in a sqlite database. It utilizes Beautifulsoup to parse the initial page for [PacketStorm News] ( https://packetstormsecurity.com/news) and [PacketStorm Files] (https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/). It then figures out the number of articles and number of pages to parse based on "Showing 1-25 of XXXXX". Further it will parse all the pages of News and Files to dump it in sqlite database. For news, it also utilizes [newspaper] (https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) to store the text, author, summary of that particular news.
