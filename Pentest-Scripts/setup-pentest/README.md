# Penetration Testing Toolset
## by Peter Bassill

The root of the folder contains a series of automation scripts. The only one present at the moment is the External_Enum.sh

This script ensures compliance against the following standards:
* ISO17025:2017 - General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories
* ISO27001:2013 - Information security management systems
* ISO9001:2015  - Quality management systems

This is the hardcore bash version. It is advisable that you read these instructions.
Any updates to the Automatatron are controlled. To make an update:

 1. Fork the Git Repo
 2. Make your changes and make damn sure you comment your changes.
 3. Push the changes to the Git Repo
 4. Email Pete with the changes


## Usage
This repo current has three scripts, the builder, an enumeration and recon script and a scanning script. All scripts should be run on your kali box with root permissions. Either sudo it or become root and run. It goes without saying that screen is essential here.

Create your base folder structure:

`mkdir /home/userName/Engagements/clientName`

### Hedgehog Build
This script will set up your initial environment or update your current environment with all the Hedgehog goodness.

### Enumeration & Recon
This script is best run over night. From the base folder:

`/opt/pentest/External_Enum.sh -d client.tld`

### Active Scanning

This script can take a few hours to run, depending on the quanity of IP addresses. IP addresses should be in ./Scope/ip.txt and there should be one IP address per line.

`/opt/pentest/External_Scan.sh -f path_to_ip_list -eA`
